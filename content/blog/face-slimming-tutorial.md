#### Step 3: Apply the Perfect Prompt

For **natural, professional results**, use this exact prompt:

```
Make the subject's face slightly slimmer while preserving identity. 
Clean minor skin blemishes. Light natural retouch only. 
Keep pores and authentic skin texture. No plastic smoothing.
```

#### Step 4: Fine-Tune If Needed

If the first result is too subtle:
```
Make the face slimming more noticeable but still natural-looking.
Maintain facial proportions and authentic features.
```

Focus on refining the jawline while keeping natural appearance.
```

## Advanced Techniques for Power Users

### Multi-Angle Enhancement
For profile or 3/4 angle photos:
```
Refine the facial contours from this angle. Subtle slimming 
of visible cheek area while maintaining natural bone structure.
```

### Combined Enhancement
Get the full glow-up in one go:
```
Light facial slimming + enhance skin tone + improve lighting.

```

### Batch Processing Strategy
Working with multiple photos? Use this workflow:
1. Process your best photo first to establish the look
2. Use consistent prompts across the series  
3. Start new sessions every 4-5 edits to prevent AI drift

## The Secret Sauce: Professional Prompting Tips

### ‚úÖ **Do This**
- Use "subtle," "natural," "light" in your prompts
- Specify "preserve identity" or "maintain authentic features"
- Ask for "professional" or "polished" results
- Include "no plastic smoothing" or "keep skin texture"

### ‚ùå **Avoid This**
- Words like "dramatic," "major," or "significant"
- Multiple conflicting requests in one prompt
- Overly technical terminology
- Requests that alter bone structure

## Common Mistakes and Quick Fixes

### Problem: Face looks "plastic" or over-smoothed
**Solution:** Add "preserve natural skin texture" to your prompt

### Problem: Features look distorted
**Solution:** Restart the session and use gentler language like "very subtle"

### Problem: Identity drift (you don't look like yourself)
**Solution:** Always include "preserve identity" or "maintain facial features"

### Problem: Inconsistent results
**Solution:** Be specific about what to keep vs. what to change

4. **Be honest** - If using for professional purposes, ensure accuracy

### When to Stop Editing
- If friends wouldn't recognize you
- If the changes feel uncomfortable 
- If you're trying to look like someone else
- If the editing becomes compulsive

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Low-Quality Source Photos
**Problem:** Blurry or pixelated input images
**Solution:** Try this prompt first:
```
Enhance image quality: sharpen details, improve resolution, 
reduce noise. Then apply subtle face slimming.
```

### Strong Shadows or Poor Lighting
**Problem:** Harsh shadows affecting face shape
**Solution:** 
```
Improve lighting balance, reduce harsh shadows, then apply 
gentle face slimming. Natural daylight appearance.
```

### Group Photos
**Problem:** Want to slim only your face in a group shot
**Solution:**
```
Focus enhancement on [describe your position: "person on the left," 
"woman in center," etc.]. Light face slimming for that subject only.
```

## The Technical Side: How It Actually Works

Nano Banana uses advanced computer vision to:
- **Map facial landmarks** with precise accuracy
- **Understand 3D face structure** from 2D images  
- **Apply selective adjustments** while preserving realism
